# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is my first web project. I tried to make a personal website just to practice basics that was discussed in CS50W lecture.
I definetely will continue improving the website following the course.

There are 4 .html files:
	
	index - homepage
	portfolio - suppose to have my projects, but right now has only scss inheritance practice.
	about - personal cs50w progress page
	contact - contact form

2 css files:

	main.css - main styling
	new.css - made from scss (for the sake of practice)	

## TODO

- [x] >4 .html pages with links form one to all of the others
- [x] >1 list, >1 table, >1 image
- [x] >5 css properties, >5 css selectors, >1 #id selector, >1.class selector
- [x] .css w/ >1 @media query for smaller screens
- [x] Bootstrap 4, >1 Bootstrap component, >2 Bootstarp components (grid model)
- [x] >1 SCSS variable, >1 SCSS nesting, >1 SCSS inheritance
